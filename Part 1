### Load required packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Compare exponential distrbution with the Central Limit Theorem

```{r}
#parameters
lambda <- 0.2
n <- 40
num.of.sim <- 1000
set.seed(1)

#create a matrix containing the results for the simulation

sim_matrix <- matrix(data=rexp(n*num.of.sim, lambda), nrow = num.of.sim)
#head(sim_matrix)
```



## PART 1
### We compute the means and store the results in a dataframe which is what the dplyr and ggplot2 packages take as input and it's also the typical datastructure in R. So we create a dataframe, sim_means.
### Here we want to compare the theoretical mean for an exponetial distribution, given by mu = 1/lambda = 5, to the mean of our simulated distribution.


```{r }

#compute mean for each of the 1000 simulations

sim_means <- data.frame(means = apply(sim_matrix, 1, mean))

total_mean <- sim_means %>%
  summarise(simulated.mean = mean (means)) %>%
  unlist()

#Plot sample means distribution

sim_means %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = means)) + geom_histogram(alpha=0.4, binwidth= .25, fill = "salmon", col = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = total_mean , color="black", linewidth = 2) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of simulated means")

print(total_mean)

```
### The plot above shows that the distribution of he means is centered around the mean of our simulated distributions. 
### The calculated mean of the simulations, 4.99 (black vertical line) is very close to the theoretical mean of 1/lambda = 5


## PART 2
### Compare variance of sample to theoretical variance 


```{r}

#Compute Variance of the sample means

sd <- sim_means %>%
  select(means) %>%
  unlist() %>%
  sd()
var <- sd^2

print(paste("Variance of the simulated samples is", var))

#Theoretical variance
theo_var <- (((1/lambda))/sqrt(40))^2

print(paste("The theoretical variance is", theo_var))

```


### We can see that the calculated and theoretical variance are very close.



## PART 3
### Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
### From the Central limit theorem we know that the distribution of averages of normalized variables becomes that of a standard normal distribution as the sample size increases. 

### We need to normalize our sample means. Transform each mean according to the formula:

### z-score = (xbar - 1/lambda) / (1/lambda / sqrt(n)) 

### Based on the CLT the result should be a normal distribution centered at(more or less) zero. 

```{r}

#Compute mean of our normalized means
z_mean <- sim_means %>%
  mutate(z_score = (means-1/lambda) / (1/lambda / sqrt(n))) %>%
  select(z_score) %>%
  summarise(z_mean = mean(z_score)) %>%
  unlist()
print(z_mean)

#create Z scores from the sample means

sim_means %>% mutate(z_score = (means - 1/lambda) / (1/lambda / sqrt(n))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = z_score)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.1,  binwidth = 0.3, fill="green", color="black", aes(y = after_stat(density))) +
   stat_function(fun = dnorm, linewidth = 1.3) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = z_mean, color="red", size = 0.5) +
   ggtitle("Distribution of standardized \nsimulated means") +
   xlab("z-scores")





```

### From the plot we can see that the calculated means are similar to the standard normal distribution.
