### Load required packages and data

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

ToothGrowth <- data.frame(ToothGrowth)


```

## Part 1 and 2
### Perform exporatory data analysis on ToothGrowth data and provide a summary

```{r}
head(ToothGrowth)

#Structure of the dataframe
ToothGrowth %>% str()
#Summary
ToothGrowth %>% summary()

Average_Len <- ToothGrowth %>% 
  group_by(supp) %>% 
  summarise(mean_len = mean(len))

ggplot(Average_Len, aes(x = supp, y = mean_len)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(title = "Average Tooth Length by Supplement",
       x = "Supplement Type",
       y = "Average Length")
  


```

### We have a dataset with 60 observations and 3 variables
### We see that OJ (Orange Juice) is associated with greater length than VC (Vitamin C)


## PART 3
### Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there's other approaches worth considering)



## Hyptothesis 1
### Tooth length varies based on supplement taken. H0 = Tooth length does not vary depending on supplement
### Bar plot showing differences grouped by dose

```{r}

#Barplot showing the length grouped by supp and dose
# To compare OJ and VC, we have to check if the doses have the same n number
#count number of doses for each supp

Average_Len <- ToothGrowth %>% 
  group_by(supp, dose) %>% 
  summarise(mean_len = mean(len), n = n(), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(Average_Len, aes(x = factor(dose), y = mean_len, fill = supp)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, position = position_dodge(0.9)) +
  labs(title = "Average Length by Supplement and Dose", 
       x = "Dose", 
       y = "Average Length") +
  theme_minimal()


```
### The bar plot shows that all doses where given to 10 people for each supplment. We can continue on compare directly OJ and VC
### Note that we can do multiple analyses here. We will focus on just a few for the sake of time. 


```{r}

OJ_len <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ") %>% select(len)
VC_len <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC") %>% select(len)

t_test <- t.test(OJ_len, VC_len, paired = FALSE)
print(t_test)
p_val <- round(t_test$p.value,5)
print(paste("The p value between OJ and VC is:", p_val))


```
## Conclusion 1: We see that if we combine all doses that there is no significant different. 
### However, the bar plot above suggests that this is likely because the high dose (2.0)



## Hypothesis 2
### At a low dose (0.5), there is a difference between OJ and VC. H0 = There is no difference. 

```{r}

OJ_len_0.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose==0.5) %>% select(len)
VC_len_0.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC" & dose==0.5) %>% select(len)

t_test_0.5 <- t.test(OJ_len_0.5, VC_len_0.5, paired = FALSE)
print(t_test_0.5)
p_val <- round(t_test_0.5$p.value,5)
print(paste("The p value between OJ and VC is:", p_val))


```
## Conclusion 2: There is a significant difference between OJ and VC at a dose of 0.5. H0 is rejected. 



## Hypothesis 3
### At a medium dose (0.5), there is a difference between OJ and VC. H0 = There is no difference.

```{r}

OJ_len_1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose==1.0) %>% select(len)
VC_len_1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="VC" & dose==1.0) %>% select(len)

t_test_1 <- t.test(OJ_len_1, VC_len_1, paired = FALSE)
print(t_test_1)
p_val <- round(t_test_1$p.value,5)
print(paste("The p value between OJ and VC is:", p_val))


```
## Conclusion 3: There is a significant difference between OJ and VC at a dose of 1. H0 is rejected. 


## Hypothesis 4
### There is a difference between OJ dose of 0.5 and dose 1. H0 = There is no difference.  
### Note that all possible permutations could be compared but this will be the last one we do right now.

```{r}

OJ_len_0.5 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose==0.5) %>% select(len)
OJ_len_1 <- ToothGrowth %>% filter(supp=="OJ" & dose==1.0) %>% select(len)

t_test_OJ <- t.test(OJ_len_0.5, OJ_len_1, paired = FALSE)
print(t_test_OJ)
p_val <- round(t_test_OJ$p.value,5)
print(paste("The p value between OJ dose 0.5 and 1 is:", p_val))


```

## Conclusion 4: There is a significant difference between OJ doses of 0.5 and 1. H0 is rejected.
